This is the partial code/ library used in my thesis @ IISc with Prof. Ambedkar Dukkipati.<br/>
Ambedkar Dukkipati: http://drona.csa.iisc.ac.in/~ambedkar/ <br/>
Our Group @ IISc: http://sml.csa.iisc.ernet.in/SML/ <br/>

<br/>
This code is developed on the similar lines of https://github.com/rasmusbergpalm/DeepLearnToolbox and it refers to the same when required. <br/>

Please read "examplesMM.m" file for examples making use of the library.

Thanks
